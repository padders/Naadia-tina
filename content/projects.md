### Piano Juliet Kelly trio

Becoming a performer seemed an unlikely path for Juliet who discovered her natural talent for singing at a local music workshop whilst studying for a degree in economics. She had never sung in public before but it wasn't long before she was completely hooked. She has since recorded 4 albums, appeared live on radio and television and performed many sell-out shows around the UK, Europe and beyond. She has opened for such jazz legends as Ron Carter, Ahmad Jamal and Hugh Masekela and worked as a guest artist with local bands around the world.
