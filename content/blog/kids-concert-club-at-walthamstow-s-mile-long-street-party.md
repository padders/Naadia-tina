On June 5th 2022 we took part in the [Artillery’s](https://e17arttrail.co.uk/about-us/ ) Mile Long Street Party. A celebration of arts and crafts all along Walthamstow’s famous market. In collaboration with [Pearl Home Records ](http://pearlhomerecords.co.uk  )‘**The Performance is You**’ featured music from many of the KCC young performers as part of a spectacular open mic/jam/performance art session. We didn’t know what to expect and the enthusiasm with which people joined in, some of whom hadn’t played in public since before lockdown was inspirational.
