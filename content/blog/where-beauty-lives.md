What do you get when a critically acclaimed alt jazz quartet use these wildly challenging times to boldly (and remotely) collaborate with an American house music legend, an Emmy-award winning composer, Faithless’s guitarist and various other electronic artists for a “reimagining of their latest album? “Requiem For The Faithful 2.0 - The Remixes” is born!

We had been wanting to release remixes of our music since our very first album in 2012 but never quite managed to find the right moment. As the world turned upside down around us last March, we decided to do the same with our music and take a leap into electronic music territory with this new offering!

A complete “reimagining” of our latest album, which was a collection of mostly acoustic alt-jazz songs featuring vocals, double bass, grand piano and drums, the songs have been flipped on their head by unexpected lockdown collaborations with artists such as house music legend Arthur Baker, Faithless’s guitarist Dave Randall (Slovo), DJ/Producer Emmanuelle and Bafta-award nominated composer Vince Pope (Misfits, Wallander).

This weird and wonderful combination of contrasting soundscapes has allowed us to create a truly memorable and quirky slice of electronic music! Irene x
