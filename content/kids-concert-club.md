Naadia started 'Kids Concert Club' in early 2019 when her childrens' school was unable to put on concerts. Using a friend's living room and with 10 young performers 'Kid's Concert Club' was born.

The ethos is relaxed and informal with an emphasis on collaboration and support.

In January 2020 Kids Concert Club was chosen by the National Lottery to receive funding from their Community fund. Concert number 3 finally happened in February 2022 at Walthamstow Trades Hall in collaboration with the amazing ['Pearl Home Records'](http://pearlhomerecords.co.uk/)  and was broadcast live on [Repeater Radio. ](https://www.mixcloud.com/RepeaterRadio/golden-is-my-name-live-from-walthamstow-trades-hall-02242022/   "repeater radio ")

We had several fantastic performances from a talented and dedicated group of children, many of whom returned for our Summer event and they performed alongside Sound Artists from the Pearl Home community. It was a joyful multi-genre and multi-generational celebration of music and spoken word which included the launch of a double A side, seven inch single by [‘Newham Folk Archive’](https://pearlhomerecords.bandcamp.com/album/how-many-in-a-bowl-snakes-with-nasty-little-faces )

**Kids Concert Club at the Walthamstow Mile Long Street Party**

On June 5th 2022 we took part in the [Artillery’s](https://e17arttrail.co.uk/about-us/  ) Mile Long Street Party. A celebration of arts and crafts all along Walthamstow’s famous market. In collaboration with [Pearl Home Records](http://pearlhomerecords.co.uk ) ‘**The Performance is You**’ featured music from many of the KCC young performers as part of a spectacular open mic/jam/performance art session. ![](/uploads/mile-long-street-party-photo.jpeg)

We didn’t know what to expect and the enthusiasm with which people joined in, some of whom hadn’t played in public since before lockdown was inspirational. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVy3aUrwb_0) to get a flavour of the day."""
